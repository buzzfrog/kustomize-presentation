# kustomize-presentation
In this repository I have saved all resources needed to do a presentation and demonstration of kustomize.

My rough [demo script](presentation/demo-script.txt) can help you go through what i did.

## Requirements to run the demo
Here is a list, I may have forgotten somethings
* Kind (to create a local cluster)
* kubectl cli
* kustomize cli
* flux cli
* helm cli
* k9s (a ui to kubernetes)
